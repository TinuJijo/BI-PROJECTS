## Process Breakdown

### Data Gathering & Transformation
- Utilized **XLOOKUP** and **INDEX/MATCH** functions to efficiently retrieve and consolidate data from multiple sources (orders, customers, products).
- Handled missing data and performed data cleaning to ensure data integrity.
- Created calculated columns for sales figures and derived more readable coffee type and roast names using **IF functions**.

### Data Modeling
- Converted data range to an **Excel Table** for dynamic updates and simplified data management.
- Ensured data quality by checking for and removing duplicate entries.

### Data Analysis & Visualization
- Developed **pivot tables** and **pivot charts** to summarize and visualize sales data.
- Created a variety of visualizations, including:

  - **Total Sales Over Time**: A line chart displaying sales trends over time, segmented by coffee type.
  - **Sales by Country**: A bar chart illustrating sales performance across different countries.
  - **Top 5 Customers**: A bar chart showcasing the top-performing customers based on sales value.

### Interactive Dashboard Design
- Designed a user-friendly dashboard incorporating interactive elements to facilitate data exploration.
- Implemented:
  - **Timeline Control**: A timeline slicer to filter data and visualizations by date range.
  - **Slicers**: Slicers for filtering data by coffee roast, package size, and customer loyalty card status.

### Dashboard Enhancements
- Improved dashboard aesthetics and usability through:
  - **Custom Chart Formatting**: Applied custom colors, labels, and titles to charts for enhanced clarity and visual appeal.
  - **Custom Slicer Styling**: Created custom slicer styles for a consistent and professional look.
  - **Layout and Design**: Optimized dashboard layout for clear presentation and easy navigation. Utilized cell alignment and shapes to create a visually appealing header.
  - **Accessibility Considerations**: Enabled horizontal and vertical scroll bars to accommodate users with varying screen sizes.
  - **Formula Bar and Header Hiding (with toggle)**: Demonstrated a technique to hide interface elements for a cleaner dashboard view, while providing a way to restore them for accessibility.
